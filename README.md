## Usage

NOTE: `<name-of-your-hubot>` is the hubot name you configured in the slack integration

Once deployment is complete, you should be able to access `https://<name-of-your-site>.azurewebsites.net/<name-of-your-hubot>/help` and see the list of commands available in Hubot.

In you slack channel you should also be able to `<name-of-your-hubot> help` to also see the list of available commands (for example `hutbot help`)

## Adding additonal hubot scripts

See https://hubot.github.com/docs/#scripts for instructions on adding additional script.

Unfortunately [Slingshot](https://github.com/projectkudu/slingshot) (the project that implements the Deploy To Azure button) does not currently support continuous deployment (see [https://github.com/projectkudu/slingshot/issues/21](https://github.com/projectkudu/slingshot/issues/21)). This means that changes to your repository are not automatically deployed.

Instead, once you have pushed your changes to your repository, you have to manually sync via the portal. If you go the web app blade, you will see a 'deployment' tile. Clicking on this will bring up a new blade with a 'Sync' button. Clicking on the 'Sync' button will pull the latest changes from your repository. When complete, click 'Restart' to restart your web app to see the new scripts.
